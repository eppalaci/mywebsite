      <p>I was born in <a href=http://https://www.visitcalifornia.com"> Orange County</a>, California. I moved to las vegas over 10 years ago. At first it was very difficult to adapt to life in Las Vegas, however moving to Las Vegas has helped me evolve into the person I am today. It has made me gain new experiences; such as work experience, developing different hobbies and interests. Nevada has been a very interesting life experience.</p>
